# Background
The Photon and Neutron Experimental Techniques (PaNET) ontology is a taxonomy of experimental techniques relevant to the Photon and Neutron (PaN) community. It was developed as part of the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) Photon and Neutron Data Service (ExPaNDS) project.

The Zenodo paper [1] introducing the ontology also discussed some possible future developments. In particular, the authors noted that PaNET v1.0 implies key relationships which could be defined explicitly using object properties.

This piece of work aims to add four object properties and the corresponding relevant classes to the ontology.
